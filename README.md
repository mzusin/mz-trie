## Definition
**Trie** (derived from re**trie**val) is a type of k-ary **search tree** used for storing and searching a specific string from a set. It is used to store a large amount of strings. The **pattern matching** can be done efficiently using tries. For example dictionary, such as one found on a mobile phone for autocompletion and spell-checking.

Using trie, the key can be searched in **O(M)** time, where M is the **maximum string length**. However, the penalty is the storage requirements.
